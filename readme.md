# Graded Project - Mahanoro Station
  
The challenge is to build out this app and get it working with redux, compound components and styled components. This is a website that will allow us to reserve some seats in "Taxi brousses" departing from Mahanoro station.

## Overview

![screenshot](./design/finished-project-screenshot.png)
 
- My demo:
The demo of my project can be seen by clicking [this netlify link](https://mahanoro-station-rinon.netlify.app/">).

- My experience:
I have solidified my knowledge about **Redux, Compound components and Styled-components**.

Fistly, I did not use connect in this project. All are done with hooks.

- The structure of this project:
 I have a few folders in the root foler:
 - The **Action** folder contains all of the actions that are beein dispatched in some files in the **containers** folder.

 - The **Components** folder contains all the components files needed for the **Pages** and the **Containers**.  
    - This components folder is actually divided into a few different folders. Every file in the **containers** folder has their own component folder. The same architecture as the `Netflix clone project`.
    
 - All of the actions are used in the container files and all of the container files are imported in the **Pages** folder. 

 - All of the states are in the **state.js** file with their default values.

-   If I had more time, I would make my code much cleaner and spend more time on the styles. Finishing the account page well and fixing bugs that I have in the booking seats page. I would refactor my code and style it much better.

- I have learned so much about using *redux* with *compound-component*. I wanted to use `react-modal` for the modal but I did not have time. Next time!

- The most challenging part for me is the booking page and the account page.

- Comment:
This is a delicious project. It is challenging but also enjoyable. Thank you very much.
